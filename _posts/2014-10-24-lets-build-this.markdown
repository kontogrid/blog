Hi, 

this is our first post - let me describe what we aim for:

* Parsing of Exports of any online banking system (and normalizing them!!!)
* IBAN based system - this is to aggregate all the different senders that might show up
* export to CSV and QIF
* simple web app to show financial status
* small mobile clients to push new data

The Idea is quite old for me - and I could not find any solution out there that does this.
