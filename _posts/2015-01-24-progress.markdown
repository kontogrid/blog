Well, to put it simple - I thought I would be faster...


Right now the Parser is working quite well for Bawag (Austria) but I have not tried any other export file.
In parallel the UI is being built. Right now all it can do is create and edit accounts with a minimal validation for
different bank accounts.


To get a working release the following three components have to work:

* API
  this is built with Symfony2 and FosRestBundle
* Parser
  Support for one institution is fine, but not enough.
  For mor information on the Parser watch: https://github.com/kontogrid/Parser
  I'll try to push more regularly
* Web App
  I fell in love with AngularJS 2 months ago, it's awesome and the foundation of the app. All the communication is
  done through the API


Target for the first beta is around June
